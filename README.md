## Treasure finding problem

As a player 'o' in a One-Dimension environment, all actions it can execute are discretely 'left' and 'right', the goal is to get the treasure '#', the example will show how player learn to get the treasure.

It's all reference to the example Morvan give at his tutorial chapter 1,
all I did is formalizing it into a OpenAI Gym form.
